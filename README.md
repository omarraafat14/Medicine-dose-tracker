# Medicine-dose-tracker
A web app with a simple UI where a user can sign up for an account. Once logged in, the user is presented with a simple form to add medicine name, dosages, and frequency. After adding those details, the user can view, edit, or delete this information.


# Requirements
- Signup page and API: User can sign up for an account.
- Login page and API: After signup, the user can log in to their account.
- Account page: On this page, the user can add and view medicines.
- Input for the new data can be taken via an HTML form which has three fields:
  - Medicine Name - String
  - Dosage - Quantity (Integer) with units (String) or a freeform text field (String)
  - Frequency - Quantity (Integer) with units (String) or freeform text field (String)
- The user can see their data in the form of a list (tracked medicines, dosages, and frequency). They can also update and delete existing data. Update can be done via a similar form as adding new data (with field values already populated with existing data).
